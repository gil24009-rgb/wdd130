      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Photo Gallery is a simple, visually focused website where visitors can browse curated
        photo collections without distractions. The goal is to present images in a clean,
        readable layout that works well on both mobile and desktop while providing clear
        navigation and a consistent visual style.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The primary audience is general visitors who enjoy photography and want an easy browsing
        experience. Secondary audiences include classmates and instructors reviewing layout,
        responsiveness, and visual design quality in a web project.
      </p>

      <h2>Style Guide</h2>

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <p>
        Palette URL:
        <a href="https://coolors.co/0b1320-176b87-64ccc5-f7f7f2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
          >https://coolors.co/0b1320-176b87-64ccc5-f7f7f2</a
        >
      </p>

      <table class="colors">
        <tr>
          <th>Primary</th>
          <th>Secondary</th>
          <th>Accent 1</th>
          <th>Accent 2</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="primary"></td>
          <td class="secondary"></td>
          <td class="accent1"></td>
          <td class="accent2"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <p>
        Headings use a clean display font for strong hierarchy, and paragraphs use a highly
        readable sans serif for comfortable scanning on screens. This pairing supports a
        gallery style site where images are the main focus and text stays clear and minimal.
      </p>

      <h4>Heading Font: Poppins</h4>
      <h4>Paragraph Font: Inter</h4>

      <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
      <p>
        This gallery highlights photo collections built around light, color, and composition.
        Each collection uses consistent spacing and captions so visitors can focus on the
        images without guessing where to click or how to navigate.
      </p>

      <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
      <p class="colored">
        The site uses a calm, modern color palette with strong contrast to keep text readable
        and navigation clear across devices.
      </p>

      <h3>Navigation</h3>
      <nav>
        <a href="#">Home</a>
        <a href="#">Gallery</a>
        <a href="#">About</a>
      </nav>

      <h2>Content</h2>

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to Photo Gallery, a place to explore curated image collections organized by
        theme. Use the Gallery page to browse sets like landscapes, textures, and city scenes,
        then open any image to view it larger with its caption. If you want to understand the
        goal of the site and how the collections are organized, visit the About page for a
        short overview.

      <img src="images/home-feature.jpg" alt="Home feature image placeholder" />

      <h3>Gallery</h3>
      <p>
        The Gallery page presents multiple image collections in a grid layout that adapts to
        screen size. Each image includes a short caption to provide context. Visitors can
        select any image to view a larger version and then return to the grid without losing
        their place, making browsing smooth and predictable.

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Photo Gallery is designed around simple navigation, strong readability, and consistent
        spacing so images remain the focal point. Collections are grouped by theme and use
        clear captions to reduce confusion while browsing. The overall design choices support
        an enjoyable viewing experience on both mobile and desktop without requiring accounts,
        external data, or complex interactions.

      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site, one for each page, and list them here.
      </p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>
        The home page wireframe should show a hero image, a short welcome paragraph, and two
        featured collection tiles that link to the Gallery. Navigation stays at the top for
        quick access on all pages.
      </p>
      <img src="images/wireframe-home.png" alt="Home page wireframe placeholder" />

      <h3>Gallery</h3>
      <p>
        The gallery wireframe should show a responsive grid of images with captions. Selecting
        an image opens a larger view with a close control, then returns the visitor to the
        same scroll position in the grid.
      </p>
      <img src="images/wireframe-gallery.png" alt="Gallery page wireframe placeholder" />

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        The about wireframe should show a short site description, a small section explaining
        how collections are organized, and a simple contact line. One supporting image should
        appear near the top to keep the page visually consistent with the rest of the site.
