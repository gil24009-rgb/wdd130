      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Photo Gallery is a simple website focused on browsing curated photo collections in a
        calm, modern layout. The purpose is to help visitors explore images by theme, understand
        what each collection is about, and view photos comfortably on both mobile and desktop
        without distractions.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The primary audience is anyone who enjoys photography and wants an easy way to browse
        themed collections. Secondary audiences include classmates and instructors evaluating
        layout, readability, navigation clarity, and overall design quality for a web project.

          <td class="accent2"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <p>
        Headings use a modern display font to create clear hierarchy, while paragraphs use a
        highly readable sans serif font for comfortable scanning. This combination supports a
        gallery style site where images stay primary and text stays clear, short, and helpful.
      </p>

      <h4>Heading Font: Inter</h4>
<h4>Paragraph Font: Inter</h4>

      <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
      <p>
        Each collection in the gallery is organized by theme, with consistent spacing and
        captions to keep browsing predictable. Visitors can explore quickly, then pause on
        a single image when they want details.
      </p>

      <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
      <p class="colored">
        The site uses calm colors and strong contrast so navigation and captions remain readable
        across devices, even in bright or low light environments.
      </p>

      <h3>Navigation</h3>

        <a href="#">Home</a>

      <h3>Home</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Welcome and Purpose</strong>
        Photo Gallery is built for visitors who want to enjoy photography without clutter.
        The home page explains what the site offers, how the collections are organized, and how
        to move between pages. Instead of long instructions, the site uses simple language and
        clear navigation so visitors can start browsing immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Why Visitors Come Here</strong>
        People come to this site to explore curated sets rather than endless scrolling.
        Each collection has a theme such as landscapes, city scenes, textures, or color studies.
        The goal is to make the experience feel like a small exhibition where every image
        contributes to a consistent mood, making browsing relaxing and intentional.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What Questions the Site Answers</strong>
        Visitors often want to know what kind of photos they will see, how collections are
        grouped, and how to view images comfortably on their device. The home page answers these
        questions by describing the theme based structure, the focus on readable captions, and
        a viewing flow that supports both quick scanning and deeper viewing.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>How to Use the Site</strong>
        The navigation is intentionally short with only three pages. Visitors can start on Home,
        move to Gallery to browse images, and open the About page to learn more about the theme
        choices and content approach. This structure keeps the site manageable and avoids
        complex features that would distract from the images.
      </p>

      <h3>Gallery</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Collections and Organization</strong>
        The Gallery page is the main browsing space. Images are presented in a grid that adapts
        to screen size so visitors can scan quickly on small screens and enjoy more columns on
        larger screens. Each image includes a short caption that gives context without forcing
        the visitor to read long blocks of text.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Browsing Experience</strong>
        Visitors typically want two different speeds of viewing. Sometimes they want to move
        fast and compare multiple photos, and other times they want to focus on one image.
        The Gallery page supports both by keeping the grid consistent and by allowing a larger
        view when a visitor selects an image, then returning them back to browsing.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What Makes This Gallery Useful</strong>
        Many gallery pages feel busy or confusing because of inconsistent spacing, unclear
        captions, or too many categories. This site keeps categories limited, uses predictable
        layout rules, and maintains consistent typography so the visitor spends attention on the
        photography rather than the interface.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Information Needed to Browse</strong>
        Visitors do not need accounts or external data. The only information needed is the theme
        of each collection and a caption per image. This keeps the site fast and reliable and
        supports hosting as a simple static website, which fits the project requirements well.

      <h3>About</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>About the Concept</strong>
        The About page explains the intent of the site: a calm place to view themed photography.
        It clarifies how themes are chosen, why captions are kept short, and why the design uses
        strong contrast and generous spacing. This page helps visitors understand the meaning
        and message of the site without turning it into a blog or a personal profile.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Theme Guidelines</strong>
        Collections are grouped around clear visual ideas such as light, color, composition,
        and atmosphere. A visitor should be able to glance at a collection and understand the
        overall direction. This guidance keeps the gallery cohesive and prevents the experience
        from feeling random, which is common when images are not curated.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Design Principles</strong>
        The site prioritizes readability, consistent alignment, and predictable navigation.
        Images should be optimized for web so pages load quickly. The design avoids unnecessary
        decoration so the focus stays on photography. These choices support accessibility and
        make the experience pleasant on different screen sizes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Contact and Next Steps</strong>
        The site can include a simple contact line such as an email address or a form link later,
        but it will remain a static site without databases or external data. Future improvements
        can include more collections, better captions, and refined layouts based on wireframes,
        while keeping the site simple and maintainable.
