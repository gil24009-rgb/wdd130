          <p>
            Photo Gallery is designed for visitors who want to enjoy themed photo collections without clutter.
            The site focuses on clear navigation, comfortable spacing, and readable captions so you can browse quickly
            or slow down and view details when a photo catches your attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            Explore collections built around atmosphere, light, color, and composition. Each set is intentionally curated
            to feel cohesive, like a small exhibit where every image supports the overall mood. Visit the Gallery to browse,
            then use About to learn how themes and captions are organized.
