     <p>
        Hello everyone! My name is Sihyeon from Korea, but you can just call me Jun :)
    </p>
    <p>
        I am currently majoring in Graphic Design with a focus on UX/UI, and I am also minoring in Web Development.
    </p>
    <p>
        While I am still more comfortable with Photoshop than coding, I am enjoying the process of learning more about computers and things.
    </p>
    <p>
        I look forward to learning together with all of you in this class!
